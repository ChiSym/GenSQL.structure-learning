  #dependence:
  #  # While the CrossCat implementation in CGPM takes dependence constraints, doing so
  #  # throws a not-implemented-error. Hence, we apply a workaround:
  #  #   - Supply a map from a target column name to a list of column names.
  #  #   - Each column in said list gets moved to the target column's view.
