= Population assembly - ensure your CSV file can be modeled automatically
Ulli Schaechtle <u.schaechtle@gmail.com>

In short, most CSV files can be used for GenSQL. In practice, there are a few things to consider.

GenSQL consumes tabular data, where columns denote variables of interest and rows denote observations on these variables, like in a typical Excel file, but in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values[CSV format]. Example files can be found https://github.com/InferenceQL/inferenceql.analyses/blob/public/analyses/Satellites/data.csv[here], https://github.com/InferenceQL/inferenceql.analyses/blob/public/analyses/Stackoverflow/data.csv[here], and https://github.com/InferenceQL/inferenceql.analyses/blob/public/analyses/Gapminder/data.csv[here]. The CSV table can have empty cells - missing data is not an issue for GenSQL.

Not all columns need to record the signal of interest but users should have some intuition that a subset of the columns and rows contain information that the user cares about.

TIP: The resolution of the recorded measurements should be adequate. For example, assume a user wants to understand the relationship between public health funding and demographics using Census data.  Assume columns are variables that record health funding and demographics and each row is a State. This CSV table may not provide data fine-grained enough to discern a signal in the data showing the relationships of interest. Instead, a user may decide to look at county-level data (i.e. each row is a county) instead to find the effects they are looking for.

== Data dimensions

GenSQL works best if the data has between 3 and 1000 columns and between 100 and 1 million rows. It's always wise to start with smaller datasets first -- that means fewer rows but especially fewer columns and grow then grow the data. This allows for shorter debugging cycles.

== Data types

GenSQL focuses on two types of columns: numerical (recording real numbers) and nominal columns (recording categories). GenSQL handles ordinal columns by expressing them as nominal. Columns that are important for the interpretation of analysis results but that canâ€™t be analyzed themselves, such as index columns, can be kept but should be explicitly ignored during analysis. See https://gensql-documentation.fly.dev/structure-learning/structure-learning.html#_data_specificationssettings[this part of the documentation].

The system implements modeling of other data types, too, but most users should not work with them. They are experimental and not yet stress-tested.

TIP: GenSQL data differs from many traditional machine learning data sets in that users don't have to decide a priori on a split of columns into a target to be predicted and a set of features. Instead. GenSQL's default models model all columns and rows in the data jointly.

WARNING: Columns recording time-stamps or concrete dates should be avoided.  Often their presence implies that the table somehow encodes a kind of time series which requires a non-trivial transformation of the data to ensure columns represent self-contained variables and rows record observations on them.


== Other CAVEATS
* Every column that is modeled should have more than one unique value.
* The number of unique categories in every nominal column should be less than the number of rows in the table.
* Deterministic relationships should be avoided for analysis. For example, if a person's height is recorded in both centimeters and feet, users should https://gensql-documentation.fly.dev/structure-learning/structure-learning.html#_data_specificationssettings[ignore] this column during analysis or remove it from the data altogether.

WARNING: Column names/headers cannot contain special characters or spaces.
