=== Build a Model!

GenSQL structure-learning is built around DVC (https://dvc.org/), a project that helps with 
version control of machine learning pipelines.

The steps for building a model are encoded as dvc pipelines (see `dvc.yaml`) All we have to do is 
run the pipeline and dvc takes care of the rest.

From the root structure-learning directory (`GenSQL`), we can run the following command to get a 
list of the pipeline stages and which files they will produce giving us an overview of the work 
that will be done to build the model.

[source,bash]
----
dvc stage list
----

Now run all of the pipelines by executing:
[source,bash]
----
dvc repro
----
Run `dvc repro --help` to see different options of running the pipeline.


The output will be saved in `data/synthetic-data-gensql.csv`.

TIP: Check the automatically generated data schema in `data/cgpm-schema.edn`. Do the
statistical types match your intuition about the data? If not, should they be hardcoded in the 
link:pipeline-configuration.adoc[pipeline configuration], or is the raw data different than imagined?
