== Overview

This is a quickstart guide to help you use the GenSQL structure-learning project to build your own
models on tabular data and query them. This guide starts with building a model from an example dataset.

include::installation.adoc[]

=== Running structure-learning
Add a csv file:
[source,bash]
----
cp ~/foo/mydat.csv data/data.csv
----
Modify the `params.yaml` file as needed. And build default models:
[source,bash]
----
dvc repro
----

TIP: Check the automatically generated data schema in `data/schema.edn`. Does it look correct?
If not, see the section below on editing the schema generation.

Go to `qc/app/qc-dashboard.html` and open it with a web browser to check the quality.

You can improve the default models by further editing the `params.yaml` file.
See our xref:structure-learning::structure-learning.adoc[section on automated data
modeling].

TIP: Add columns you are particularly interested in to the `columns` section for quality control (see commented out example in the `params.yaml` file). That way, you can ensure that the model captures exactly what you care about.

If not, see the section below on editing the schema generation.

== Querying the model
There are different ways to query automatically built models from Python,
Clojure and JavaScript.
Checkout the https://github.com/OpenGen/GenSQL.query[GenSQL.query repository]
about how to query models and data.
