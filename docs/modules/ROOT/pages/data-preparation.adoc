=== Data preparation

TIP: Structure leaning expects your data file to be named data.csv and placed in GenSQL.structure_learning/data.

Most CSV files can be used for GenSQL! GenSQL consumes tabular data, where columns denote variables of interest 
and rows denote observations on these variables, like in a typical Excel file, but in 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values[CSV format]. 
Example files can be found https://github.com/InferenceQL/inferenceql.analyses/blob/public/analyses/Satellites/data.csv[here], 
https://github.com/InferenceQL/inferenceql.analyses/blob/public/analyses/Stackoverflow/data.csv[here], and 
https://github.com/InferenceQL/inferenceql.analyses/blob/public/analyses/Gapminder/data.csv[here]. 
The CSV table can have empty cells; missing data is not an issue for GenSQL.

TIP: When testing with smaller sub-sets of your data, always be sure to include your primary "of interest" columns in 
order to have a valuable testable unit. 

==== Requirements
* Every column that is modeled should have more than one unique value.
* Column names/headers cannot contain special characters or spaces.
* The number of unique categories in every nominal column should be less than the number of rows in the table.
* Deterministic relationships should be avoided for analysis. For example, if a person's height is recorded in 
both centimeters and feet, users should link:pipeline-configuration.adoc[ignore] one column during analysis or remove it from the data altogether.
* Columns recording time-stamps or concrete dates should be avoided.  Often their presence implies that the table 
somehow encodes a kind of time series which requires a non-trivial transformation of the data to ensure columns represent 
self-contained variables and rows record observations on them.

WARNING: The resolution of the recorded measurements should be adequate. For example, assume a user wants to understand the 
relationship between public health funding and demographics using Census data.  Assume columns are variables that record 
health funding and demographics and each row is a State. This CSV table may not provide data fine-grained enough to discern 
a signal in the data showing the relationships of interest. Instead, a user may decide to look at county-level data 
(i.e. each row is a county) instead to find the effects they are looking for.

==== Data dimensions

GenSQL works best if the data has between 3 and 1000 columns and between 100 and 1 million rows. It's always wise to start 
with smaller datasets first -- that means fewer rows but especially fewer columns and then grow the data. This allows for 
shorter debugging cycles.

==== Data types

GenSQL focuses on two types of columns: numerical (recording real numbers) and nominal columns (recording categories). 
GenSQL handles ordinal columns by expressing them as nominal. Columns that are important for the interpretation of analysis 
results, but that canâ€™t be analyzed themselves (such as index columns) can be kept, but should be explicitly link:pipeline-configuration.adoc[ignored] during analysis.

The system implements modeling of other data types as well, but most users should not 
work with them. They are experimental and not yet stress-tested.

TIP: GenSQL data differs from many traditional machine learning data sets in that users don't have to decide a priori 
on a split of columns into a target to be predicted and a set of features. Instead, GenSQL defaults to modeling all 
columns and rows in the data jointly.
