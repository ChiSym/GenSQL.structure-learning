= Structure learning

== Overview

Ulli TODO: Write an overview of what structure learning is and why people would want to use it. Note that model querying and 
model backends are not addressed in the quick start, so those would be good topics to introduce here.

We recommend that you start with the Quickstart, then use the individual documents for remembering how to do steps later.
