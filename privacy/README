Welcome to the Privacy Experiment on the CES 2022 Dataset

Some things to note:

    o The dataset is the first 20000 rows of the full 60000 row dataset,
      of which params.yaml subsamples 16000.
    o Custom change in dvc.yaml to copy a canned copy of schema.edn into
      the data directory rather than run through guess-schema. It was 
      taking too long and all of the statistical types are explicitly
      set in params.yaml
    o Custom change in dvc.yaml to set --jobs 4 in xcat-complete-import
      because I had some trouble running out of memory, but this was 
      with a larger version of the dataset so likely not an issue. No
      harm, though.
    o Custom change to scripts/predict.py to save the classifier's
      predictive probabilities as a new column in data/predictions.csv
      (needed for the ROC plot). In each row we select the probability
      value corresponding to the choice in the 'prediction' column
      for that row.
    o For demonstration purposes we recode the target feature CC22_320a
      (President Biden's approval rating in 2022) from a 5-tuple to a
      binary choice in which "Strongly approve" and "Somewhat approve"
      both map to 1 and all other responses (including "Not sure")
      mapped to 0.
    o Four modeling runs were done with the parameters in params.yaml
      (16000 row subsample, 16 sample_count, 200 loom extra_passes,
      600 minutes of runtime for CGPM). This gave a little over 32
      CGPM iterations. In all four runs the random seed was the same.
    o Full copies of the data and qc directories, as well as the main
      configuration files for each modeling run are available in
      privacy/models under the subdirectories:

	original/	Model built from the original dataset
	synthetic/	Model built from a synthetic dataset that
			was generated from the original model
	edited/		Model built from the synthetic dataset
			with two features:
				presvote16post
				presvote20post
			held independent of the target CC22_302a
			feature (see params.yaml)
	extra/		Model built from the synthetic dataset
			with five features:
				presvote16post
				presvote20post
				ideo5
				pew_religimp
				religpew
			held independent of the target CC22_302a
			feature (see params.yaml)
    o The features held independent in the 'edited' and 'extra'
      models were those with the highest mutual information shared
      with CC22_320a:
				presvote20post	0.443
				presvote16post	0.328
				ideo5		0.288
				pew_religimp	0.076
				religpew	0.067
    o The model currently found in the main data subdirectory is the 'extra'
      model.
    o I should have renamed the target feature from the beginning... Lesson
      learned!

PROCEDURE

The goal here was to generate a classifer on the data from each model after
mapping the values for the CC22_320a feature from a five-tuple to binary as
described above. The way this was done is to modify each of the four CSV files
that serve as inputs to the 'predict' stage:

	data/data.csv
	data/ignored.csv
	data/synthetic-data-iql.csv
	data/test/test.csv

Convert the data from the target column to binary, and write the modified files
to:

	binary/{original,synthetic,edited,extra}/

along with the model's data/schema.edn file. Then run a custom script
containing the same prediction command found in dvc.yaml on these modified
files and generate a new output predictions.csv file. Statistics and an ROC
plot are then produced from the new predictions.csv file.

HOWTO

To convert the CC22_320a feature columns to binary, execute:

	privacy/scripts/convert-to-binary

Now to generate the predictions you'll need to enter the 'devenv shell'
environment and run

	privacy/make-predictions original
	privacy/make-predictions synthetic
	privacy/make-predictions edited
	privacy/make-predictions extra

To evaluate the classifier predictions via common metrics you need to:

    (1) exit from the 'devenv shell' environment
    (2) cd to one of the subdirectories under binary/
        for example, 'original':

	cd privacy/binary/original

    (3) execute

	../../scripts/evaluate-classifier-statistics

    (4) Generate an ROC plot

	../../scripts/evaluate-classifier-roc

CONCERNS

Please look at privacy/scripts/evaluate-classifier-roc to make sure it is
doing the right thing with the predictions.csv data.
